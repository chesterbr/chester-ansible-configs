# chester-ansible-configs

This project contains the configuration for my personal projects (which I automated in an effort to further explore [Ansible][7], [Vagrant][12] and related tools), and published because:

- Ansible exemples may be useful to someone else (despite being very specific to my stuff);
- It keeps me honest (makes me write scripts that don't suck much, forces me not to have plaintext secrets, exposes security flaws, etc.);
- Public github is free! ;-)

Feel free to use it (I'm licensing as MIT to ensure that) and to open issues or [contact me][6] if you find something awry.

If you want to learn Ansible, I strongly recommend [Jeff Geerling][11]'s [Ansible for DevOps][8].

## What does it configure?

### chester.me (blog)

My [personal blog][4], currently based on a [forked Octopress 2.x][5].

### cruzalinhas.com [WIP]

An app that allows quickly finding public transportation routes in São Paulo. See [source code][1] or [website][3] for details. It shares she same nginx with the blog above.

### miniTruco server [TODO]

This is a simple Java app that listens on the 6912 port, handling communication between [miniTruco][2] clients and spawning bot players to fill incomplete tables (a miniTruco table requires 4 players).
