# chester-ansible-configs

This project contains the configuration for my personal projects (which I automated in an effort to further explore [Ansible][7], [Vagrant][12] and related tools), and published because:

- Ansible exemples may be useful to someone else (despite being very specific to my stuff);
- It keeps me honest (makes me write scripts that don't suck much, forces me not to have plaintext secrets, exposes security flaws, etc.);
- ~Public github is free~ [Not really a reason anymore](https://github.blog/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/) ðŸŽ‰

Feel free to use it (I'm licensing as MIT to ensure that) and to open issues or [contact me][6] if you find something awry.

If you want to learn Ansible, I strongly recommend [Jeff Geerling][11]'s [Ansible for DevOps][8]. Several tasks here were based on tasks on his book or some of [his tasks in Ansble Galaxy](15).

## What does it configure?

### cruzalinhas

An app that allows quickly finding public transportation routes in SÃ£o Paulo. See [source code][1] or [website][3] for details. It shares the same nginx with the Toronto Transit (below).

### Toronto Transit for Pebble

Back-end for a Pebble app that finds the nearest bus/streetcar stops and shows how long it will take for the next vehicles to arrive.

### miniTruco server

This is a simple Java app that listens on the 6912 port, handling communication between [miniTruco][2] clients and spawning bot players to fill incomplete tables (a miniTruco table requires 4 players).

## Older scripts (not actively maintained)

### Home automation Raspberry Pi

Before switching to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), I manually configured my RPi to add voice control to my [lights](https://chester.me/archives/2017/12/controlling-rf-outlets-from-a-raspberry-pi/) and [TV](https://chester.me/archives/2017/12/voice-control-for-a-non-smart-tv-with-google-home-raspberry-pi-lirc-nginx-lua-ifttt/), among other home automation tasks. For that I had plabooks to [provision](rpi_provisioning.yml) it and [configure the apps](rpi.yml), so I could tinker with confidence.

## Quick setup (Mac OS X)

This will get you a VM capable of running any of those services:

```
brew update
brew install rbenv ansible
brew cask install virtualbox vagrant
vagrant up
```

To install one (or more) of the services on the virtual machine, run its playbook:

```
ansible-playbook <playbook name>.yml -i hosts,
```

(alternatively you can use `-i .vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory`, but it will log in with the default user for Ubuntu provisioning, not the `{{ admin_user }}` defined on the global vars)

Run this script to enable development sites (it redirects ports - until reboot - and add entries to `/etc/hosts`; run it again to revert all changes):
```
sudo ./config-dev-environment
```

Now you can open, say, [http://dev.chester.me](http://dev.chester.me).

### Passwords vault

A few tasks (including the initial run of each playbook) require you to supply your own [password vault][13]. See [the sample file][14] for details.

### Production provisioning

Initial server setup is done by running `provisioning.yml` with the root user (`-u root`) against the proper host (one of its tasks is to create the proper user, then disable root and password-based logins).

Once that is done, playbooks may be ran on the proper hosts. Currently I ran all of them on the same host, but they can theoretically live in different machines.

### Maintenance tasks

Those are tagged on the playbooks, please check them for such tags and add to `ansible-playbook`. Examples:

- To download new data from sptrans: `--tags update_sptrans_data`;
- To deploy the latest version of cruzalinhas or toronto-transit-time: `--tags update_app`.
