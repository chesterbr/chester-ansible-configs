# Initial configuration for the Raspberry Pi that handles my home automation
#
# This playbook just ensures I have my user there, that it is a sudoer and
# that I can ssh with my own key, so I can use it for all other tasks
# in the main playbook (rpi.yml).
#
# Given it will likely be ran when an image was freshly baked, we also use the
# opportunity to bump all packages to latest in distro, configure my chosen
# hostname/timezone/static IP and give it a good reboot, so it's ready to rumble
#
# To provision from zero:
#   - Burn Raspbian (>= Stretch) Lite image to SD with balenaEtecher (or dd)
#   - Before putting the SD card on RPi, mount it and:
#     - Create empty SSH file (touch /Volumes/boot/SSH)
#     - Create wpa_supplicant.conf (vi /Volumes/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf)
#       (model here: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/82923/100572)
#   - Unmount, put on RPi and boot it
#   - Wait a bit (it will cycle-boot at least once), figure out the IP it got
#     from the router (either look at screen or router setup), then run:
#     below (password is raspberry):
#        ansible-playbook rpi_provisioning.yml -k
#   - Supply the default "raspberry" password (for the last time in your life)
#
# Hints:
#   - Ensure your router is redirecting ports 80, 443 and 8123 to
#     this RPi's network adaptor (also 22 once it's fully locked down)
#   - mDNS just works: once you reboot, you should be able to
#     access your RPi with <host>.local (e.g.: tv-pi.local on mine)
#     for ssh, etc.
#   - Easy way to make your computer forget about old versions of
#     that ip/hostname:
#       ssh-keygen -R ip.of.your.pi
#       ssh-keygen -R <host>.local
#   - My network went bananas when I tried to access my dynamic DNS name,
#     but adding an entry pointing it to the internal IP of the RPi
#     to /etc/hosts (or better: your router's DNS, if it allwos that)
#     fixes it.
